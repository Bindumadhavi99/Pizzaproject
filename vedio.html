<p><h1>Finally, select a standout feature in the pizzeria. This is the one design element that makes your place unique and captures the attention of your customers immediately. This main focal point should be fairly big when it comes to size, such as occupying a whole section of the restaurant, or a whole wall, and should be clearly visible the moment you walk into the pizzeria. Ideas include a giant chalkboard wall that lists your menu, a wall covered in decorative tile, or a large fireplace.
